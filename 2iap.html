							<p>A major issue with polymers and plastics in general, is the flammability of the material and its abundancy in every day life which leads to safety risks. 
								While government regulations such as fire extinguishers and fire escapes help lowering the risk for injury, they do not solve the root problem.</p>
							<p>In this project, I addressed the fundamental flammability issue of polymers by developing a new kind of flame-retardant polymer. 
								This new material moreover tackles the issue of environmental pollution by using a bio-based polymer which is compatible to most sustainable bio-plastic materials. 
								This was a 8-months project at Fraunhofer IAP which then served as my master thesis. </p>
							<p>I was responsible for the material development from co-formulating the idea on paper, to the proof of concept by synthesizing the material in the lab, their characterization of thermal, mechanical and fire behavior properties and finally the upscaling to industrial production (injection moulding and extrusion). 
								The final product is a starch-based flame retardant, modified with phosphorus-nitrogen synergy systems. 
								Exceeding the project’s scope and in the limited time available, I was able to optimize the customer’s manufacturing process by combining two steps with a creative approach.
								The biggest challenge of this project for me, as an engineer was the chemical synthesis. 
								However, with the help of literature and guidance by colleagues, I was able to learn and adapt the methods to finally perform the entire synthesis procedure by myself.  </p>
							<p>	<li>elemental analysis: ICP-OES, CHNS-O analyzer, Raman spectroscopy</li>
								<li>mechanical: tensile, charpy</li>
								<li>thermal: DSC, TGA and HDT</li>
								<li>flame testing: UL-94, LOI</li>
